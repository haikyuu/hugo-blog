This blog is for me.

It's an organized library of things i think about or little things i learned.

I am writing in here so that I:

- Remember things i learned.
- Put my half finished thoughts somewhere other than my brain to prevent their loss.

If you are reading this, i'd like to thank you for visiting. Send me an email or a DM in twitter ðŸ‘‹
