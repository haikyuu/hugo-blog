## Introduction
I am a full stack developer and all my experience was spent building SPA or mobile apps (React and react-native).

I always wanted to learn another language. Here are some that interest me:
- Python because of edge-db. (not so much because they have a JS adapter now)
- Reason because it's a functional language that's close to JS (syntax wise) and with good support for React. 
- Typescript because of types.
- Elm because it's safe, different and provides a great DX. Downside (depends!) is it challenges the status quo on everything.
- Ruby because of Rails. I want to be a better full-stack developer. And i only heard good things about Rails.

I settled with Ruby because i highly appreciate and respect DHH views and opinions and i found [Stimulus](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus) and [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) to be very promising.
And the new secret technology that changes the paradigm of writing front-end apps is ... exciting to say the least!

When i searched online for the best way to learn Ruby, i found that just diving in Rails and learning ruby along the way can work since i already have xp with proggramming.

Here are the things i want to learn in this journey:
- How to write Server Side apps. The old way!
- Ruby.
- TDD.
- Rails and its philosophy.

I will share my progress here. Wish me luck ☘️
